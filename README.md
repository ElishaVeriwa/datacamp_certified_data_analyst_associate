## DataCamp Associate Data Analyst Certification Exam

![DataCamp Certification](https://github.com/ElishaVeriwa/datacamp_certified_data_analyst_associate/blob/main/Certification.jpg)

### 📊 Project Overview
PetMind, a leading US-based pet product retailer, is pivoting its strategy to maximize long-term value through "everyday" product categories (e.g., food) rather than one-off luxury items (e.g., toys). This analysis evaluates the impact of **repeat purchases** on sales performance to validate whether the company's focus on consumables is driving sustainable revenue growth.

### 🎯 Analysis Goals & Objectives
The project is structured around four primary research objectives to satisfy the certification requirements:
1. **Data Governance**: Validating all 1,500 records against the data schema, handling missing values, and ensuring data type consistency across all 8 variables.
2. **Class Balance Assessment**: Evaluating the distribution of 'Repeat Purchases' to determine if the subscription-focused strategy has significant market penetration.
3. **Revenue Distribution**: Statistical profiling of 'Sales' to understand baseline performance and variance across product lines.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Quantifying the relationship between customer retention (repeat buying) and total sales volume.

### 📈 Project Workflow
- **Exploration**: Initial assessment of data health and identifying discrepancies between raw input and the target data dictionary.
- **Cleaning**: Applying systematic corrections to categorical and numeric fields (e.g., standardizing 'category' labels and imputing price medians).
- **Visualization**: Utilizing React-based charts to visualize distributions and correlations.
- **Interpretation**: Drawing actionable insights for PetMind's marketing and inventory departments.

### 🗂️ Dataset Insights
The dataset comprises 1,500 records across 8 key variables. A detailed data dictionary and variable descriptions can be found in the [official documentation](https://github.com/ElishaVeriwa/datacamp_certified_data_analyst_associate/blob/main/Practical%2B-%2BDAA%2B-%2BPet%2BSupplies%2B-%2B2212.pdf).

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Data Integrity & Quality Governance
Conducting a comprehensive audit of all categorical and numeric variables to ensure alignment with the data dictionary.
- **Validation**: Verifying entries in `category`, `animal`, and `size`.
- **Null Management**: Identifying and systematically addressing missing data in `price` and `rating` variables.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing data types to ensure high-fidelity computation of sales metrics.

#### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Developing graphical representations to uncover latent patterns in consumer behavior.
- **Frequency Distribution**: Visualizing the prevalence of repeat purchases to assess business health and class balance.
- **Revenue Profiling**: Analyzing the statistical distribution of sales performance across the 1,500 observation points.
- **Relational Dynamics**: Mapping the correlation between repeat purchase status and total sales to identify revenue drivers.

### 📜 Certification
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the **DataCamp Associate Data Analyst** certification. It demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business communication using standard industry practices.
